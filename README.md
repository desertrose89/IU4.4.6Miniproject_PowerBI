# IU4.4.6Miniproject_PowerBI
Using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures and building an interactive dashboard using PowerBI

**Key KPIs**
1 Machine Utilization - Helps engineers in understanding idle time of machines to maximize on the total production time
2 Right First Time - Helps in identifying machines that are taking multiple iterations to get the final product. Machines getting the product right on the first attempts should be utilized more and those with lower right first time rate should be diagnosed
3 Scrap rate - Machines generally should produce more of the final product and less of any scrap pieces which takes effort and further cost to process
4 Downtime minutes - Helps engineers in identifying machines that are prone to failure and need maintenance
5 Rework rate - Helps in identifying which products and machines need more reworks on the final products in turn slowing down the total production rate leading to high cost
6 Production pieces - Total produced pieces of the machine vs the expected total production. Helps in identifying which machines have been working at full capacity and producing high quality final products

**Assignment**
Create a visualization dashboard to track important KPIs of the plant's operational process
1. Calculate the below listed KPIs(measures) using DAX [45 – 60 mins] [Marks: 30]
2. Create charts to track the overall trend of the above calculated metrics over the given time period. Also, create a KPI card highlighting the overall values for each KPIs across the given time period in the data [90 – 120 mins] [Marks: 50]
3. Create list of filters at top of the dashboard to filter for the above designed metrics tracker [20 - 40 mins] [Marks: 20]
I. Line ID
II. Team ID
III. Date
4. Bonus Question: Is there a correlation between (i) total production and scrap pieces
produced, (ii) total production and rework pieces? What is the magnitude of correlation?
[25 - 40 mins]
